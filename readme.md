This is a program I made for fun to generate padorus inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/dQ_d_VKrFgM)
There are currently a few types of eyes, hair and other stuff, I may add more if I am motivated.
The program is very slow because it is not well coded but ah well at least it works ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

If you just want to test it, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Escartem/InfinitePadorus/releases/latest), (only for Windows) or you can download the source code to see the python file.
To run the program just do ```python padoru.py```

If you want to contribute, feel free to make a PR :)
